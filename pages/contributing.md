# How to contribute to this wiki/ Knowledge Base ?



### First time users 

1. Setup your GitHub account (if you already haven't) and share your GitHub ID with the Principal Investigator or one of the Senior Investigators in the lab. Inform them of your interest in contributing to the lab wiki. Either the PI or one of the Senior Investigators will add you to the wiki repository as a contributor. 
2. Install Github Desktop and link it with your Github profile. 
3. Go to [https://github.com/coinslab/Knowledge-Base](https://github.com/coinslab/Knowledge-Base) and click on Code -> Open with Github Desktop

This should create a clone of the `Knowledge-Base` repository in your local machine. 

4. Now you can go to the file location in your computer where you have cloned the `Knowledge Base` repository.
5. You can create contents for this site as a Markdown file(.md) inside the pages folder in `Knowledge Base` 
   - You can use softwares like Typora for creating & editing markdown files. Documentation on Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://franklinjl.org/syntax/markdown/).
6. Once you are done with writing/updating your section, you can commit your changes and push the changes to the Github using your Github Desktop client. Now inform the Senior Investigator who is in charge of this site. He/She will build and publish the updates.  

### Experienced users 

- If you are not contributing for the first time, always fetch from the cloud and make sure everything is in-sync with the cloud, before beginning to work on the documentation.
